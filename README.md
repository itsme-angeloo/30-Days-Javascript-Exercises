# 30-Days-Javascript-Exercises
JavaScript challenges for 30 days

## Week 1: JavaScript Basics

**Day 1:** Declare variables for your name, age, and favorite color. Display them using `console.log()`.
**Day 2:** Use `prompt()` to get user input for name and age, then greet the user.
**Day 3:** Create two number variables and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
**Day 4:** Write a script to check if a number is even or odd.
**Day 5:** Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to assign a grade based on a score (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
**Day 6:** Create a script that checks if a user is old enough (18+) to vote.
**Day 7:** Create a temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit).

## Week 2: Control Flow & Loops

**Day 8:** Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
**Day 9:** Use a `while` loop to print even numbers from 2 to 20.
**Day 10:** Write a script that adds all numbers from 1 to 100.
**Day 11:** Create a multiplication table for any number using a loop.
**Day 12:** Use a loop to reverse a string entered by the user.
**Day 13:** Print all numbers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 3 or 5.
**Day 14:** Count how many vowels are in a given string.

## Week 3: Functions & Arrays

**Day 15:** Create a function that takes a name and prints a greeting.
**Day 16:** Create a function to calculate the area of a circle from its radius.
**Day 17:** Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.
**Day 18:** Create an array of your top 5 favorite movies. Print each with a loop.
**Day 19:** Add and remove items from an array. Try using `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()`.
**Day 20:** Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average.
**Day 21:** Sort an array of numbers in ascending order (without using `.sort()`).

## Week 4: Objects & Real-World Practice

**Day 22:** Create an object for a student with properties like name, age, and course.
**Day 23:** Add a method to the student object that returns a string summary.
**Day 24:** Loop through the object’s properties using a `for...in` loop.
**Day 25:** Create a simple address book with 3 contacts (objects in an array).
**Day 26:** Write a program that simulates a basic calculator using functions.
**Day 27:** Create a function that checks if a word is a palindrome.
**Day 28:** Create a `to-do list` program using an array and functions to add/remove tasks.

## Week 5: Wrap-Up Projects

**Day 29:** Make a simple number guessing game (1–10).
**Day 30:** Combine everything into a mini "Personal Info App" that asks for your name, age, and favorite things, stores them in an object, and prints a summary.
